# Compact Smart Display

A sleek and informative screen that shows local weather and real-time market trends for your favourite assets. Can be powered through USB by any device with an Internet connection and runs `python3`. The Python script runs on host device and forwards live data to Arduino (ATmega328) through USB serial. This system operates without the need of a WiFi module.
